# Offloading-Video-Processing-Resources-via-Edge-Computing


# Project abstract
The overall goal of the project is to build tasks that can be run on a distributed non-centralized
network. More specifically for now, we plan on building a framework to offload the processing
requirement for video processing of Raspberry Pi video streams to machines that do have the
necessary processing power for such tasks. With the advent of cloud computing, more and
more processing power is delegated to remote machines. This introduces large delays. The
idea is to bring the computational resources as close to the machines that need the processing,
but do not have the hardware resources, through edge computing. This is also important
because current providers of edge computing technologies do not share their data openly to
analyze to what extent this technology can be improved. With our project, we will provide tasks
that can be monitored to help analyze load distribution on a distributed edge network. The
interface between the analogue and digital world will require the creation and implementation of
drivers. The tasks should be modular to fit within an edge computing network. The project must
also implement network monitoring features to help analyze the load of the distributed system.


# Project requirements:
In terms of hardware, the project requires the use of Raspberry Pis and cameras, which will be
provided by Professor Maheswaran to those students currently in Montreal. In terms of
software, we are to use C or C++ and the OpenCV library, which are publicly available.
